1.  Introduction

   The need exists for a unified approach to network management of
   constrained devices as well as constrained networks.  Constrained
   devices imply the solution should require minimal resources (CPU,
   memory) from the device platform; constrained networks imply the
   network management solution should impose minimal traffic on the
   network to accomplish a particular management objective.

2.  Problem Statement

   The problem of network management for constrained networks and
   devices includes a number of requirements not necessarily addressed
   by existing solutions.  Any solution must be conservative with "when"
   network traffic is required, as well as "how much" traffic is
   required in order to fulfill network management functions.  In
   addition, a solution should support "traditional" network management
   functions that have been useful in a variety of legacy use-cases, as
   well as new functionality that address the evolving constrained
   device and constrained device scenarios.  In this context, the term
   "constrained" implies limited resources (RAM, FLASH), as well as
   limited CPU resources.  Therefore, the amount of code necessary to
   achieve network management functionality will need to be as small as
   possible, as well as the amount of RAM necessary to achieve the
   functionality will be limited.  Likewise, minimal network bandwidth
   should be required to support a solution.

   The IETF is coalescing around a set of solutions for transport of
   applications on constrained networks (CoAP).  Since constrained
   devices will likely include support for this constrained "stack", it
   would be advantageous to reuse this constrained device stack for
   network management as well, to address the constrained device
   property of limited resources.

   Additionally, the IETF is moving towards YANG as a data modeling
   language for configuration and state data often attributed to network
   management problems.  Therefore, any constrained device/network
   management solution should attempt to reuse this information when and
   where possible.

Internet-Draft                CoOL Problem                    March 2016


   YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration and
   state data manipulated by the NETCONF protocol (RFC 6241), NETCONF
   remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.YANG was originally
   designed to work with the NETCONF configuration protocol; however,
   the idea of constrained networks and devices was not a factor in the
   design of NETCONF/YANG.  Any solution that attempts to use YANG in a
   constrained environment should consider constrained device and
   networking properties to the application of YANG in these scenarios.

   It would be advantageous to model the particular constrained network
   management functionality on the evolving NETCONF/RESTCONF operations,
   since some level of semantic interoperability might be expected by
   management systems that mix constrained and non-constrained
   management domains.

   One design element that could reduce the amount of traffic "on the
   wire" is requiring less metadata in management transactions.  Instead
   of endpoints semantically parsing the meaning of the data and/or
   traffic, the knowledge of the data and how it is expected to be used
   is, instead, required on the endpoints, a priori.

3.  Why CoOL ?

   Currently proposed solutions for constrained management do not
   specifically address the requirements previously suggested in this
   memo.  The solution introduced by CoOL seeks to remedy this by
   introducing an alternative method for operations and encoding "on the
   wire".  CoOL will address these requirements while still utilizing
   the IETF application "stack" and management data modeling language
   (YANG).  The alternative method employed by CoOL utilizes a more
   concise representation of management transactions (specifically
   management "data").

   The evolution of the CoOL solution will recognize the proliferation
   of the "pub/sub" design pattern by relying on extensions both at the
   CoAP, as well as CoOL protocol layers where needed.  Incorporating
   the pub/sub design pattern will assist in the application of CoOL
   into larger scale networks (both constrained and non-constrained).

   QUESTION: We need text here that describes the applicability of CoOL
   to different types of networks (different levels of administrative
   management or domain knowledge)

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations applicable to network management of
   enterprise networks is similar but different to that of constrained
   networks given the potential risk involved.  The risk involved to

   enterprise networks could be local to an organization (assets,
   reputation).  However, in the case of constrained networks, it is
   reasonable to assume significant risk due to the types of application
   domains constrained devices would be applied (sensors controlling
   everything from home automation to medical devices).  With this risk
   should come a more strict understanding of the attack vectors and
   vulnerabilities of any and all protocols in use in constrained
   networks, especially those protocols tasked with the management of a
   device.  The CoOL working group will attempt to reuse applicable
   ideas and technology originating from other IETF working groups to
   address the problem of security.  The initial focus of security will
   involve the integrity and trustworthiness of information originating
   from CoOL managed endpoints.  The confidentiality of this information
   will also be considered.
