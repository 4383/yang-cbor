--- abstract

This document describes the particular problem being addressed by the introduction of CoOL into the constrained management solution space. The description includes the basic constrained management problem, as well as properties of the solution. Details as to the CoOL protocol itself can be found in companion documents.

# Introduction

The need exists for a unified approach to network management of constrained devices as well as constrained networks. Constrained devices imply the solution should require minimal resources (CPU, memory) from the device platform; constrained networks imply the network management solution should impose minimal traffic on the network to accomplish a particular management objective.

# Problem Statement {#ref_for_later}

The problem of network management for constrained networks and devices includes a number of requirements not necessarily addressed by existing solutions. Any solution must be conservative with "when" network traffic is required, as well as "how much" traffic is required in order to fulfill network management functions. In addition, a solution should support "traditional" network management functions that have been useful in a variety of legacy use-cases, as well as new functionality that address the evolving constrained device and constrained device scenarios. In this context, the term "constrained" implies limited resources (RAM, FLASH), as well as limited CPU resources.  Therefore, the amount of code necessary to achieve network management functionality will need to be as small as possible, as well as the amount of RAM necessary to achieve the functionality will be limited. Likewise, minimal network bandwidth should be required to support a solution.

The IETF is coalescing around a set of solutions for transport of applications on constrained networks (CoAP).  Since constrained devices will likely include support for this constrained "stack", it would be advantageous to reuse this constrained device stack for network management as well, to address the constrained device property of limited resources.

Additionally, the IETF is moving towards YANG as a data modeling language for configuration and state data often attributed to network management problems.  Therefore, any constrained device/network management solution should attempt to reuse this information when and where possible.

YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration and state data manipulated by the NETCONF protocol (RFC 6241), NETCONF remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.YANG was originally designed to work with the NETCONF configuration protocol; however, the idea of constrained networks and devices was not a factor in the design of NETCONF/YANG.  Any solution that attempts to use YANG in a constrained environment should consider constrained device and networking properties to the application of YANG in these scenarios.

It would be advantageous to model the particular constrained network management functionality on the evolving NETCONF/RESTCONF operations, since some level of semantic interoperability might be expected by management systems that mix constrained and non-constrained management domains.

One design element that could reduce the amount of traffic "on the wire" is requiring less metadata in management transactions. Instead of endpoints semantically parsing the meaning of the data and/or traffic, the knowledge of the data and how it is expected to be used is, instead, required on the endpoints, a priori.

# Why CoOL ?

Currently proposed solutions for constrained management do not specifically address the requirements previously suggested in this memo.  The solution introduced by CoOL seeks to remedy this by introducing an alternative method for operations and encoding "on the wire". CoOL will address these requirements while still utilizing the IETF application "stack" and management data modeling language (YANG). The alternative method employed by CoOL utilizes a more concise representation of management transactions (specifically management "data").

The evolution of the CoOL solution will recognize the proliferation of the "pub/sub" design pattern by relying on extensions both at the CoAP, as well as CoOL protocol layers where needed. Incorporating the pub/sub design pattern will assist in the application of CoOL into larger scale networks (both constrained and non-constrained).

# Roadmap

Within the CORE group, there is currently two thread of development of a management interface for constrained devices and networks, one based on unmanaged identifiers (YANG hash) and one based on managed identifiers (SID). Some aspects of these solutions are shared (Problem statement and Data representation) and some are distinct (Identifiers and Function set).

The following drafts are currently available:

# Security Considerations

The security considerations applicable to network management of enterprise networks is similar but different to that of constrained networks given the potential risk involved.  The risk involved to enterprise networks could be local to an organization (assets, reputation). However, in the case of constrained networks, it is reasonable to assume significant risk due to the types of application domains constrained devices would be applied (sensors controlling everything from home automation to medical devices).  With this risk should come a more strict understanding of the attack vectors and vulnerabilities of any and all protocols in use in constrained networks, especially those protocols tasked with the management of a device. The CoOL working group will attempt to reuse applicable ideas and technology originating from other IETF working groups to address the problem of security. The initial focus of security will involve the integrity and trustworthiness of information originating from CoOL managed endpoints. The confidentiality of this information will also be considered.
